### Welcome to SyncSpace Mobile :rocket:

## Intro
SyncSpace Mobile is the mobile counterpart to SyncSpace (who would've thought). Built using Ionic with React, we can build iOS and Android apps simultaneously with just one codebase. 

# How to run locally
1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Run `npm i -g @ionic/cli` in your terminal to install the Ionic CLI globally.
3. Run `npm i` in the terminal to install the rest of the dependencies (be warned it's like 400 mb).
4. Make sure you're in the correct directory (syncspace-mobile) and run `ionic serve` to start the server.
5. Once the browser opens, go into developer tools (Command+Option+I or Ctrl+Shift+I) and change the viewport to an iPhone for iOS styling or an Android for (wait for it)

That's it! If you need more help, go to [Ionic's full guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli) for more information
